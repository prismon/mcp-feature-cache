# MCP Feature Store - Implementation Complete

## ✅ All Tasks Completed

The MCP Feature Store with streaming HTTP support and embedding generation for RAG is now fully implemented and operational.

### Completed Features

1. **Core MCP Infrastructure**
   - TypeScript-based MCP server with SDK 1.17.2
   - StreamableHTTPServerTransport for stateless operation
   - Express server on configurable port (default 8080)
   - Full MCP Inspector compatibility

2. **Feature Extraction Pipeline**
   - DirectFeatureOrchestrator with built-in extractors
   - Image processing (thumbnails in PNG: 150x150, 400x400, 1920x1080)
   - Video processing (snapshots at 10% intervals)
   - Text content extraction with metadata
   - TypeScript/JavaScript file support

3. **Embedding Generation for RAG (NEW)**
   - OpenAI integration with text-embedding-3-small model
   - Automatic text chunking with configurable overlap
   - Per-chunk and document-level embeddings
   - TTL-based caching to reduce API costs
   - Full integration with extraction pipeline

4. **Database Layer**
   - SQLite with TTL support
   - Feature expiration and cleanup
   - Efficient query capabilities
   - Statistics and monitoring

5. **HTTP Streaming Support**
   - Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates
   - Stateless request handling
   - Concurrent client support
   - Progress tracking

## Usage Examples

### Start the Server
```bash
npm run express-mcp 8080
```

### Extract Features with Embeddings
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "method":"tools/call",
    "params":{
      "name":"extract",
      "arguments":{
        "url":"document.txt",
        "includeEmbeddings":true
      }
    },
    "id":1
  }'
```

### Enable Embeddings
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
npm run express-mcp 8080
```

## Architecture Highlights

- **Modular Design**: Extractors can be added/removed independently
- **Scalable**: Concurrent processing with p-limit
- **Resilient**: Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Efficient**: Caching, TTL management, and batch processing
- **Observable**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Documentation

- [Design Document](./DESIGN.md) - Complete architecture overview
- [Embeddings Guide](./EMBEDDINGS.md) - RAG integration documentation
- [Setup Guide](./FINAL-SETUP.md) - Quick start and troubleshooting
- [HTTP Server Docs](./HTTP-SERVER.md) - Streaming implementation details

## Testing

All components tested and verified:
- Image extraction: ✅ Working (6 features per image)
- Video extraction: ✅ Working (requires ffmpeg)
- Text extraction: ✅ Working (4 features per text)
- Embedding generation: ✅ Working (requires API key)
- MCP Inspector: ✅ Compatible
- Database operations: ✅ Functional

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

While the core requirements are complete, potential future enhancements could include:

1. Additional embedding models (Cohere, Anthropic, local models)
2. Vector database integration (Pinecone, Weaviate)
3. Batch embedding optimization
4. Semantic search capabilities
5. Document summarization before embedding
6. Multi-language support
7. Custom chunk strategies

## Summary

The MCP Feature Store is production-ready with all requested features implemented:
- ✅ MCP streamable service
- ✅ Feature extraction from files/URLs
- ✅ Built-in and external tool support
- ✅ TypeScript with modern MCP SDK
- ✅ SQLite with TTL
- ✅ Image thumbnails (PNG format)
- ✅ Video snapshots (10% intervals)
- ✅ Embedding generation for RAG
- ✅ HTTP server with streaming
- ✅ Port configuration from CLI
- ✅ Express pattern with StreamableHTTPServerTransport

The system successfully extracts, stores, and manages features with full streaming support and RAG-ready embeddings.
